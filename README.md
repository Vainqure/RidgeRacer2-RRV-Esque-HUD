# Ridge Racer 2's RRV-esque HUD

A Ridge Racer V-esque HUD for Ridge Racer 2 (PSP) using [Ridge Racer 2 - HD Texture Project (Repacked)](https://github.com/jcchikikomori/RidgeRacer2-HD-repacked) as the base for this project.

This texture pack features redone HUD textures based off of Ridge Racer V's HUD and fonts, Nothing else.

## How to use

- Download the pack through [here](https://github.com/dataDrawing/RidgeRacer2-RRV-Esque-HUD/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) (or go to Code > Download ZIP)
- Extract the .ZIP file and rename the folder to the region code of the game (see [Compatibility](https://github.com/dataDrawing/RidgeRacer2-RRV-Esque-HUD#compatiblity))
  - For example: Rename `RidgeRacer2-RRV-Esque-HUD-main` to `UCES00422`
- Import the folder to PPSSPP's textures folder (`/PSP/TEXTURES`)
  - You have to create the `TEXTURES` folder yourself if you don't have one
  - You can also package all of the folder's content onto a .ZIP file, and choose it in PPSSPP just like how you'd choose a ROM file

## Compatiblity

Tested with `UCES00422` (Europe).<br>`UCAS40119` (Asia) and `ULJS00080` (Japan) are not tested and aren't guaranteed to work.
